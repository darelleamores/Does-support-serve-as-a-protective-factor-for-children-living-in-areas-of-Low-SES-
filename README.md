# Does support serve as a protective factor for children living in areas of Low SES?

# Abstract 
Background: Various research have shown significance results that an individual living environment plays a significant role in the outcome of academic performance. Individuals who live in areas of low poverty or SES, do worse than individuals who come from better living conditions in terms of health, living conditions, and even academic performance. However, research has shown that students who have a support system at home or school do better than their peers who do not have a support system. The purpose of this study is to understand the significance of support in a student’s academic performance even when they are living in areas that are filled with adverse environmental factors such as high crime rate, food desert, and poverty. 

Method: Students(N=16,422) in grades 5,6, 7,8, and 11 participated to take the 2018-2019 California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) test which is consist of English and Math proportion. The students were later surveyed a year later after taking the test. A binary logistic regression was used to determine the effects of demographics, SES, grade, and support towards CAASP english and math test results using RStudio and SAS. GIS was also used to determine the spatial analysis of student’s living conditions and the problematic factors that come with it by zipcode. 

# Results: Students who had support at Home (OR = 1.19, P<.001) and School(OR = 1.04, P<.001) had positive effects towards passing the CAASP English portion, as well as the CAASP Math portion (OR = 1.16, P<.001, OR 1.06, P<.001) respectively. In terms of Race/Ethnicity compared to whites, African Americans had the lowest odds in doing well in the CAASP tests. 

# Conclusion: Home and school support is a significant indicator for increase academic achievement and standardized test scores for students who come from areas of high risks such as high crime rates, poverty, and food deserts. Create resources, programs and policies that help at-risk populations for academic achievement.

# Does support serve as a protective factor for children living in areas of Low SES?

# Background

Various research have shown significance results that an individual living environment plays a significant role in the outcome of academic performance. Individuals who live in areas of low poverty or SES, do worse than individuals who come from better living conditions in terms of health, living conditions, and even academic performance. However, research has shown that students who have a support system at home or school do better than their peers who do not have a support system. The purpose of this study is to understand the significance of support in a studentâ€™s academic performance even when they are living in areas that are filled with adverse environmental factors such as high crime rate, food desert, and poverty.

# Does support serve as a protective factor for children living in areas of Low SES?

# Abstract 
Background: Various research have shown significance results that an individual living environment plays a significant role in the outcome of academic performance. Individuals who live in areas of low poverty or SES, do worse than individuals who come from better living conditions in terms of health, living conditions, and even academic performance. However, research has shown that students who have a support system at home or school do better than their peers who do not have a support system. The purpose of this study is to understand the significance of support in a student’s academic performance even when they are living in areas that are filled with adverse environmental factors such as high crime rate, food desert, and poverty. 

Method: Students(N=16,422) in grades 5,6, 7,8, and 11 participated to take the 2018-2019 California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) test which is consist of English and Math proportion. The students were later surveyed a year later after taking the test. A binary logistic regression was used to determine the effects of demographics, SES, grade, and support towards CAASP english and math test results using RStudio and SAS. GIS was also used to determine the spatial analysis of student’s living conditions and the problematic factors that come with it by zipcode. 

 Results: Students who had support at Home (OR = 1.19, P<.001) and School(OR = 1.04, P<.001) had positive effects towards passing the CAASP English portion, as well as the CAASP Math portion (OR = 1.16, P<.001, OR 1.06, P<.001) respectively. In terms of Race/Ethnicity compared to whites, African Americans had the lowest odds in doing well in the CAASP tests. 

 Conclusion: Home and school support is a significant indicator for increase academic achievement and standardized test scores for students who come from areas of high risks such as high crime rates, poverty, and food deserts. Create resources, programs and policies that help at-risk populations for academic achievement.

# Introduction
Education for one’s well-being is a powerful predictor for health behaviors and health risks. Individuals who have higher achievement performance in education showed higher rates in positive health outcomes and decrease participation risky behaviors such as smoking and alcohol abuse, and violent crimes (Hahn & Truman, 2015). According to reports from the CDC, individuals who lived in households with a bachelor’s degree or higher, had decrease obesity prevalence compared to households with less than a high school education(CDC, 2020).  Inversely, individuals who had the lowest academic performance in education showed higher rates of obesity, alcohol & drug abuse, smoking, injury and even crime leading to prison detainment (Bayless et al., 2018).  An adolescent’s academic performance and attainment can be affected by their own living environment and conditions (Crede, Wirthwein, McElvany, & Steinmayr, 2015). Individuals who live in poverty are adversely affected by the social and environmental factors such as food deserts and high crime rates, and are part of the lower economic status spectrum (Meade, 2014) (Neff, Palmer, McKenzie, & Lawrence, 2009). Low income areas also lack clean streets, public areas, and even walkable sidewalks. Thus, these areas have decreased traffic safety and physical activity thus will lead to higher rates of diseases (Neckerman et al., 2009). There is a high percentage of minority groups such as Hispanics and African Americans living in these low-income areas.
 Low socioeconomic status (SES) areas are plagued with food deserts, or areas where it is hard to buy fresh, affordable, good quality food (Hilmers, Hilmers, & Dave, 2012). These food deserts are characterized by a few supermarkets, lots of convenient stores, and fast food joints that sell saturated, fatty processed foods that is affordable for the population(Widener, Metcalf, & Bar-Yam, 2012).  The affordable and convenient compensation for the poverty area stricken with food deserts has shown there is significant decrease in academic performance, as well as showing increased obesity in children. There is a correlation between a child’s test scores and if he/she lives in a highly dense food desert area (Frndak, 2014). Children living in food deserts do poorly than children who do not live in a food desert. Increased consumption of high saturated fats and carbs can lead to detrimental cognitive effects that lead to poor academic performance. However, if a child is living in a food desert area but comes from a higher income family, it can negate the correlated effects of poor academic performance by food desert prevalence thus high SES can be a protective factor against the negative effects of a food desert areas (Frndak, 2014). To make matters worse, food deserts have shown a significant correspondence with a higher crime rate which is evident in overlapping characteristics of poverty areas(Crowe, Lacy, & Columbus, 2018).  Low SES have a higher rate of being involved or witnessing crime and violence. Prolonged exposure to crime and violence creates risks in academic learning by affecting the cognitive function of the brain that affects memory attention which helps in academic performance (Moffitt & Klaus-Grawe Think, 2013). Violence through an individual’s stress response decreases cognitive function thus leading to lower academic performance; it can even cause developmental issues in a child (Cybele Raver & Blair, 2016). Heightened exposure to violence also have shown to increase maladaptive behaviors such as increase aggressiveness and even promoting violence themselves while creating consequences towards academic performance(Haynie, Silver, & Teasdale, 2006). Students who participated in violent behaviors such as fights at school lead to increased school dropouts and lower grades which are common  in lower SES areas (Jensen, 2009). However, when rates of violence is decreased in neighborhoods and schools, there is an increase in academic performance (Casillas et al., 2012).  
Academic performance is an important inference for societal foundation and learning skills such as if individuals who have poor grades are more likely to drop out of school, increased societal exclusion, and even decreased health outcomes (Hughes, Cao, West, Allee Smith, & Cerda, 2017). Poor academic performance is also positively associated with substance abuse, unsafe sexual activity, and poor mental health (Cox, Zhang, Johnson, & Bender, 2007). Minority groups such as African Americans and Hispanics are reported to have increased risk to participate in these adverse health behaviors due to having poor academic performance compared to their White counterparts such indicating achievement disparities in the education system (APA, 2017). This gap in the education system between minority groups and whites can be due to higher reports of discrimination, unfair treatment, and marginalization from not only from school faculty but from their living conditions as well which are derived from variables such as stress, tension, lack of communication for needs and resources, and fear(APA, 2012). 
Research has indicated that school and family support shown protective effects against low academic performance due to poverty factors(Kim, Mazza, Zwanziger, & Henry, 2014). Family support towards a child’s education in low SES areas have shown to do better than individuals who did not have family support while living in the same environment(Conger, Conger, & Martin, 2010). They also found that if the parent(s) had full-time employment and was not able to support the child in school, lead to negative impacts in learning in math and science  (Mayo & Siraj, 2015). On the other hand, when a child is neglected by family, it seems to increase maladaptive behavior in the child which can lead to lower academic performance regardless of poverty level even though there is high correlation between neglect and poverty level(Herruzo, Raya Trenas, Pino, & Herruzo, 2020).  Studies have shown that supportive relationships from family, friends and teachers from school have acted as a buffer for better academic performance even when a child comes from a low socioeconomic setting that has high rates of socioeconomic stressors that lead to poor cognitive learning (Rezaei-Dehaghani, Keshvari, & Paki, 2018). 
The objective of this study is to examine the environmental and social factors that affect academic achievement such as crime rates, food deserts, and social support to model the Pass/Did Not Pass outcome of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASP) tests for San Bernardino Unified School District (SBCUSD) students from grade levels 4,5, 6, 7,8 and 11. Demographic and descriptive variables such as students’ date of birth, gender, race/ethnicity, low SES status and environmental living conditions by zip code were also accounted for in the analysis. The first hypothesis is that SBUSD students will have better test scores while controlling for age, gender, grade level, race/ ethnicity, and low SES status if given the different areas of support which are support from school, support from home, and outside support other than school and home. The second hypothesis indicates that SBCUSD students living in lower SES areas that are characterized by higher high crime rate, lower average median income, and increased density of food deserts will have lower test scores than students who have better living conditions.

#Methods 
Participants and Procedures
Participants were students from the SBCUSD in Southern California. The data collected was during the school year of 2018-2019 which comprised of 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th , 8th , and 11th graders. Students each year are required to take the CAASP which is comprised of an English and Math portion. The CAASP test was designed to help teachers in the State of California to help monitor the needs and success of individual students in their classrooms. After completing the CAASP test, a survey instrument measured school climate, social emotional learning, risky behaviors of the students, school support, home support outside support, physical and mental health, food and nutrition, and discrimination. Post surveys were administered in English, in a single class period and to minimize impact on instructional time, the number of questions asked were limited. Surveys that were given which were based on the California Healthy Kids Survey Resiliency Module which assessed school support, home support and home support. These responses were linked to the student’s record (grade level, home zip code, free or reduced lunch (low SES status, gender, and grade level.), de-identified, and given a LLU student ID marker to keep consistency in responses for the CAASP and survey response data. These responses were made available for researchers for analysis. A total of 16,422 students aged 9 to 19 years old participated in both the CAASP test and the survey. As shown in Table 1, majority of the students were Male and Hispanic. More than half of the students qualified for free lunch (low SES status).
